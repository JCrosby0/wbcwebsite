register in the joint membership type for the discount to be applied._

In Machine pitch the ball is “pitched” to the batter via a machine to ensure a steady and
consistent flight path to make it easier for the batters to hit the ball.
This season we hope to participate in a Friday night competition with some other nearby
clubs.
